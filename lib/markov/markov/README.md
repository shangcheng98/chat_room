A generic implementation of a [Markov chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) in Rust. It
supports all types that implement `Eq`, `Hash`, and `Clone`, and has some specific helpers for
working with `String` as text generation is the most likely use case. You can find up-to-date,
ready-to-use documentation online [on docs.rs][doc].

__Note__: `markov` is in passive maintenance mode. It should work well for its intended use case
(largely textual generation, especially in chat bots and the like), but will likely not grow to any
further use cases. If it does not meet your needs in a broad sense, you should likely fork it or
develop a more purpose-built library. Nevertheless, bug reports will still be triaged and fixed.

## Examples ##

With Strings: 
```rust,no_run
extern crate markov;

use markov::Chain;

fn main() {
    let mut chain = Chain::new();
    chain.feed_str("I like cats and I like dogs.");
    println!("{:?}", chain.generate_str());
}
```

With integers:
```rust,no_run
extern crate markov;

use markov::Chain;

fn main() {
    let mut chain = Chain::new();
    chain.feed(vec![1u8, 2, 3, 5]).feed([3u8, 9, 2]);
    println!("{:?}", chain.generate());
}
```

Chains have iterators (both infinite and sized!):
```rust,no_run
extern crate markov;

use markov::Chain;

fn main() {
    let mut chain = Chain::new();
    chain.feed_str("I like cats and I like dogs.");
    for line in chain.iter_for(5) {
        println!("{:?}", line);
    }
}
```

Chains can be higher-order:
```rust,no_run
extern crate markov;

use markov::Chain;

fn main() {
    let mut chain = Chain::of_order(2);
    chain.feed_str("I like cats and I like dogs.");
    for line in chain.iter_for(5) {
        println!("{:?}", line);
    }
}
```

## Contributing ##
Contributions to this library would be immensely appreciated. It should be noted that as this is a
public domain project, any contributions will thus be released into the public domain as well.
